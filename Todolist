[ IN PROGRESS ]

- Update documentation
- (JS/PHP) Add pagination in tables


[ BUGS ]

    [ GENERAL ]

    - Reloading the menu makes the blue bar of the menu disappear


    [ REPOS ]

    - When mirroring with 'Check GPG signatures', see how to deal with the case of RPM packages that have no signatures, e.g :
        wget https://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-connectors-community/el/7/x86_64/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
        /usr/bin/rpm -qp --qf "%|DSAHEADER?{%{DSAHEADER:pgpsig}}:{%|RSAHEADER?{%{RSAHEADER:pgpsig}}:{(none}|}| %{NVRA}\n" mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
    - (KO) Mirror a debian repo with translations => translations are not included by reprepro
    - (KO) Mirror a debian repo with multiple archs and translations => translations are not included by reprepro
    - (DEB) Error with reprepro hanging while mirroring ubuntu > jammy > main
        https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1056380
        https://salsa.debian.org/debian/reprepro.git


    [ OPERATIONS ]

    - (RPM mirroring) Ignore warning if 'already contains identical signature' is found in the output of rpm --addsign


    [ SERVICE ]

    - logparser is sometimes using too much cpu, see how to improve


[ IMPROVEMENTS / FEATURES ]

    [ GENERAL ]

    - (JS) Refactor and mutualize the ajax functions
    - Better handle errors in execute.php


    [ REPOS ]
    
    - Add a search bar in the repos list
    - Support Arch Linux packages https://blog.desdelinux.net/en/create-your-local-arch-linux-repository/
    - Operations: replace 'reconstruct' with 'rebuild'
    - Think about a way to publish debian repos in a more elegant way. Currently: https://<FQDN>/repo/debian/dists/buster/main_prod buster main_prod
    - (RPM) See how to accelerate the rpm signing process by using multi-threading
    - (DEB) Add a feature to be able to add distributions to the list of pre-defined distributions (and do the same for sections)


    [ STATS ]

    - Convert 'Last access requets' table to a paginated table


    [ HOSTS / LINUPDATE ]

    - Be able to ask a host to update one or more specific packages
    

    [ CVE ]

    - Check for affected hosts when sending packages with linupdate


    [ LOGIN ]

    - Support SSO
