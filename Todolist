[ IN PROGRESS ]

    [ GENERAL ]
    
    - Update documentation


    [ STATS ]
    
    - logparser is sometimes using too much cpu, see how to improve
    - repo stats retrieving is too slow when dealing with millions of lines in database, see how to improve


[ BUGS ]

    [ GENERAL ]


    [ REPOS ]

    - When mirroring with 'Check GPG signatures', see how to deal with the case of RPM packages that have no signatures, e.g :
        wget https://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-connectors-community/el/7/x86_64/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
        /usr/bin/rpm -qp --qf "%|DSAHEADER?{%{DSAHEADER:pgpsig}}:{%|RSAHEADER?{%{RSAHEADER:pgpsig}}:{(none}|}| %{NVRA}\n" mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
    - (KO) Mirror a debian repo with translations => translations are not included by reprepro
    - (KO) Mirror a debian repo with multiple archs and translations => translations are not included by reprepro


    [ OPERATIONS ]

    - (RPM mirroring) Ignore warning if 'already contains identical signature' is found in the output of rpm --addsign
    - Regular planned tasks logs are all merged into the same Planification master log file


    [ SERVICE ]

    [ GENERAL ]

    - (JS) Refactor and mutualize the ajax functions
    - Better handle errors in execute.php

    - Support Arch Linux packages https://blog.desdelinux.net/en/create-your-local-arch-linux-repository/
    - Operations: replace 'reconstruct' with 'rebuild'
    - Think about a way to publish debian repos in a more elegant way. Currently: https://<FQDN>/repo/debian/dists/buster/main_prod buster main_prod
    - (RPM) See how to accelerate the rpm signing process by using multi-threading
    - (DEB) Add a feature to be able to add distributions to the list of pre-defined distributions (and do the same for sections)
    - (DEB) Repository install: if the repository has 'src' packages, also add the 'deb-src' line to the installation command lines
    

    [ SETTINGS ]

    - Deprecate 'Allow planifications to update repositories' setting and enable it by default
